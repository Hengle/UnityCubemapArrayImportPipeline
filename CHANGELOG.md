## [1.2.0] - 2020-11-03
### Fixed 
 - Fixed compile error in Unity 2020.2 (ScriptedImporter was moved to a different namespace)
 - Don't display the CubemapArray imported object twice in the Inspector


## [1.1.0] - 2020-05-18
### Fixed 
 - When running in Unity 2020.1 and newer, use the new built-in CubemapArray preview when viewing a CubemapArray asset in the Inspector. The built-in preview is way nicer and has more features than my implementation for Unity 2019.3.
 - Several minor documentation fixes.
